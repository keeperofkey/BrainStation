# Identify and Analyze Risks that could impact the launch of going paper less for a insurance company.

- Data Disclosure.
- Unauthorized Access to Systems which have sensitive Data
- Phishing Campaign

# Recommendations

- Encrypt Data on Systems (AES-256)

- Encrypt Data in Transit & Use Secure Transportation Protocols

- Implement Access Controls

- Implement MFA

  - Ask for Authentication were necessary/accessing Sensitive Information

# Qualitative Risk Assessment

- Data Disclosure - Critical
- Unauthorized Access - High
- Phishing Campaign - High

# NIST SP 800-12 Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

- Implement Zero Trust

- Implement MFA

- Strong Password Entrophy

- SIEM implementation for System Logs Monitoring for Employee Access & incorporate UEBA

- Routine Audits on System Logs

# Risk Register

- incomplete feedback sessions resulting in a loss of cost of product and need to recruit new volunteers
  - loss of product and resources
    - very likely
    - tolerable
    - incentivise feedback completion
    - outreach and customer support

  - mitigation
    - MFA
    - strong password hygiene
  - responablity
    - users
    - developers
    - admins

# acceptable risk

- incomplete feedback sessions may be acceptable if the cost of product is less then the cost of conferences

# risk response plan

- password attacks due to their prevalence
- should be prioritized for mitigation
- MFA can protect and mitigate

# residual risk

- acceptable

# Insider Threat
