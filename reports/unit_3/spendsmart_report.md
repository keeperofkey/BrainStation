## Executive Summary

### Key Strengths:

- Secure design principles followed for system architecture
- Comprehensive security testing conducted including SAST, DAST, penetration testing
- Input validation implemented to prevent common vulnerabilities
- Encryption used for data protection

### Areas for Improvement:

- Lack of automated security scanning and testing
- Slow remediation times for identified vulnerabilities
- Minimal use of configuration management for production systems

### Critical Findings:

- Unpatched systems and software in production due to slow patching cadence
- SQL injection vulnerabilities possible due to lack of input sanitization

### Suggested Actions:

- Increase automation in testing and scanning to ensure consistency
- Improve vulnerability management process to accelerate remediation
- Implement configuration management tools for production systems
- Enforce production deployment checklist to ensure security controls applied
- Conduct security training for developers to build secure coding skills

## Methodology

## Results

### Planning phase:

The technical implementation details indicate a focus on security requirements like encryption, access controls, logging, and secure storage. While a formal risk assessment process is not mentioned, the security measures described aim to mitigate common risks like data breaches. Regulatory and compliance needs are not referenced but appear partially addressed through encryption, logging, and access controls that follow security best practices, though formal compliance processes are not described.

### Analysis phase:

Sensitive data is identified and classified per data guidelines, encrypted with AES-256 before storage, and protected in transit via TLS. Access is restricted and logged to mitigate data breach, account takeover, and fraud threats. New features increase attack surface so role-based access control and principle of least privilege are followed to limit authorization.

### Design phase

Multi-factor authentication, role-based access controls, AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit, and secure logging of transactions and activities provide security. Input validation and sanitization should be added for user-supplied data. Proper key management, security audits, and penetration testing are also recommended.

### Development phase:

Code changes undergo peer review before merging. Selenium provides browser testing. Snyk is not used for dependency and code scanning during development. Automation focuses on integration over security. Git enables version control and branching for collaboration, with assumed MFA login. Jira provides issue tracking.

### Testing phase:

It is unclear if comprehensive security testing like SAST, DAST, and penetration testing is conducted during testing. More details on methodology and scope are needed. Automation for consistent security testing is not mentioned and would need to be clarified. The process for remediating vulnerabilities is undefined; more information is required on prioritization, tracking, and remediation.

### Implementation phase:

It is unclear if deployment scripts and configurations undergo security reviews. Configuration management processes for deployed systems are undefined. The process for reviewing/approving production changes is not defined. An incident response plan for deployment is not mentioned. Processes are undefined for security patch management, continuous monitoring during maintenance, log reviews, and actions from security events.

### Maintenance phase

While no specific patching process is mentioned, logs are securely stored with access controls and encryption. Continuous monitoring occurs via 24/7 IDS on network traffic and systems. Jira used for ticket management and prioritization, but update timeline remains vague and more tools could be used for dependency scanning and DAST, SAST, or IAST should be explored.

## Recommendations

Security requirements lack specifics on input validation, error handling, session management, network security, compliance, and auditing. Enhancing requirements with more details is recommended. The SDLC has strengths like code reviews, testing, and scanning but lacks formal processes for security testing, patching, monitoring, log reviews, and incident response. Critical improvements needed around security testing methodology, vulnerability remediation, monitoring, and incident response. Implementing automated and manual security processes is advised.

The security requirements analysis identified gaps around input validation, error handling, session management, network security, compliance, and auditing/logging specifics. Enhancing the requirements with additional details in these areas is recommended to ensure shared understanding and close gaps. The SDLC security analysis found an overall adequate posture but areas for improvement exist. Strengths include code reviews, testing, and scanning while formal processes are lacking for security testing methodology, patching, monitoring, log reviews and incident response. Critical improvements are needed on security testing, vulnerability remediation, monitoring, and incident response. Implementing automated security processes is advised.

Security Requirements Analysis:

- Requirements lack specifics on input validation, error handling, session management, network security, compliance, and auditing.

- Important details missing to ensure shared understanding and close gaps.

- Recommend enhancing requirements with specifics on input validation methods, error handling, session management, network controls, compliance, and auditing/logging.

SDLC Security Analysis:

- Overall SDLC security posture appears adequate but improvements possible.

- Key strengths include use of code reviews, automated testing, code scanning.

- Areas for improvement: lack of details on security testing methodology, processes for patching, Secure by Default configuration, log reviews.

- Critical findings: Need more clarity on security testing, vulnerability remediation, monitoring, and incident response.

  - An application testing framework should be explored ideally IAST but SAST may be sufficient.

- Recommend establishing formal processes for security testing, patch management, monitoring, log reviews and incident response. Automating security processes also advised.
