# Information Gathering Report Template

## Company Background:

- History
    - OpenAI was founded in 2015 with the goal to develop safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence. They began as a non-profit organization and were committed to sharing research and patents, then they expanded with a for-profit arm of the company in 2019. Initially they were able to hire some of the top researcher in the field and greatly impacted the speed of innovation in the field.
    
    - Key milestones or significant events:
        - OpenAI released GPT-1 in 2017 which introduced the concept of generative pre-trained transformers which was a major milestone in the field as the previous models required a lot of human supervision to train and well annotated data. GPT uses a mixture of initial unsupervised phase followed by a supervised "fine tuning".
        
        - In 2019 they released GPT-2 which was a 10 fold improvement over GPT-1. Notably the team at OpenAI used transfer learning to train a team of Dota 2 bots that were able to defeat the top human players in the world.
        
        - Continuing the development GPT-3 was released in 2020 however it wasn't until they released GPT-3.5 in 2022 alongside their now notorious app ChatGPT that they were propelled into the spotlight with it quickly becoming the most widely used website in the world.
        
- Industry:
    - They operate in the field of AI research and development with a focus on AI powered software as a service.
    
- Competitors:
    - While all the major tech companies have their own AIs none have been as powerful or ubiquitous as OpenAI. Every model they release seems to be far more capable and has been proven to be more effective than any other. They have the advantage of setting the pace in the field and quickly develop new models so their competitors are constantly behind.
    
- Products/Services:
    - They offer a few consumer facing apps like ChatGPT and Dall-e as well as integrations and customizable models through fine-tuning.
    
- Contribution to Strategy:
    - These products and services are used to help people learn about AI and to help them understand the potential of AI. They also help companies build AI powered software as a service or integrate it into existing apps. This funds their enormous compute requirements with some estimates of $700,000 per day of server cost.

## Leadership and Key Personnel:

- Key Executives:
    - Sam Altman, CEO
    - Mira Murati, CTO  
    - Greg Brockman, President & Co-Founder
    - Brad Lightcap, COO
    - Ilya Sutskever, Co-Founder and Chief Scientist  
    - Bret Taylor, Chairman of the Board
    - Wojciech Zaremba, Co-Founder
    - John Schulman, Co-Founder
    - Jonathan Lachman, Head of Special Projects

- Professional Background/Contributions:
    - Sam Altman was one of the original funders of OpenAI and has been a key contributor to the company's success. His experience at Y combinator and YC group allowed him to raise substantial capital from investors. He has also spoken to congress on the lack if AI oversight and has warned of the potential harm these systems can inflict.
    - Mira Murati has an impressive list of achievements from her work on the development of the Tesla Model X and Leap Motion to her leading the development of ChatGPT, Dall-E, and Codex.
    - Greg Brockman helped create the founding team at OpenAI and  is responsible for some of its early success by leading the development of OpenAI Five a team of Dota 2 bots that were able to defeat the top human players in the world. Often considered a modern day stockfish adding to the growing list of games that computers are better then humans at.
    - Brad Lightcap is a trusted wingman of Sam Altman and also spent time at Y combinator. He was able to secure a massive partnership with the news conglomerate Axel Springer even amidst multiple copy write lawsuits and significant bad press.
    - Ilya Sutskever is a pioneer in the field of AI research and has greatly impacted the field of deep learning. He worked at Google Brain and contributed to TensorFlow a major ML framework. He is currently working on a "Superalignment" project that aims to steer super intelligence towards human orientated goals as a means of providing AI safety. Notably he participated in the ousting of Sam Altman over concerns that AI safty was not prioratized and stepped down from the board after his reinstatement.
    - Brett Taylor is a well known entrepreneur with a long list of successes including Google Maps, Quip, Facebook, and Salesforce. He currently sits on the board of OpenAI and Shopify and recently founded a new AI startup Sierra.
    - Wojciech Zaremba interned at Nvidia, worked at Google Brain and at Facebook AI research. He is the co-creator of Chat-GPT and heads the department responsible for Github Copilot.
    - John Schulman leads the reinforcement learning team using "trial and error" to improve the GPT models. His personal website only uses http.
    - Jonathan Lachman worked for the Obama administration specializing in strategic planning and organizational scaling

- Notable Trends/Sentiments:
    - Using social searcher we determine that OpenAI has a generally positive sentiment on social media. This could be due to their recent Sora text to video model that has shocked the field once again. There has been a significant uptick in the number of posts in the past few days. This follows a general trend of initally positive reactions to openAI's releases
